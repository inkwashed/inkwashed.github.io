<h1>Hello, world.</h1>

<p><img src="IMG_1746.jpeg"></p>

<p>My name is Corinne Jacobo. I currently work in ecommerce, mainly assisting with minor web-edits and product data integrity. I am familiar with basic HTML and CSS, but I haven't really made anything from scratch in roughly 10 years (I'm usually working with blocks of code or fixing errors in existing code lately) so this is a bit of a refresher for me. I used to make my a lot of my own graphics and code custom HTML and CSS for profiles on various social websites. My preferred editor is Atom (because it's free and I like the flexibility of it). I'm hoping to become better at coding for the web through this class, so I can apply it to my current job and also use the skills I learn here for personal projects in the future.</p>
